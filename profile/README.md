  <h2>What Are Baby Carriers and Their Benefits?</h2>
  <p>
    Baby carriers are devices designed to carry a baby on an adult's body, available in forms like slings, wraps, and structured carriers. 
    They are suitable for newborns to toddlers and offer several benefits:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Convenience:</strong> Freeing hands for other tasks.</li>
    <li><strong>Bonding:</strong> Enhancing closeness and attachment, which can boost breast milk production and improve breastfeeding success.</li>
    <li><strong>Comfort:</strong> Many are designed to distribute weight evenly, reducing strain on parents.</li>
    <li><strong>Development:</strong> Supporting healthy hip development and potentially reducing risks of SIDS and flat-head syndrome.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Research from sources like Ergobaby 
    (<em><a href="https://ergobaby.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ergonomic Baby Carriers and Baby Wrap Carriers | Ergobaby</a></em>) 
    highlights how babywearing promotes physical, emotional, and early language development, making it a valuable tool for parents.
  </p>

  <h2>How to Choose the Right Baby Carrier</h2>
  <p>
    Selecting the right baby carrier involves considering several factors:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Age and Weight Range:</strong> Ensure the carrier supports your baby from newborn to the desired age, with weight limits like 30 kg for some GROWNSY models.</li>
    <li><strong>Carrying Positions:</strong> Look for versatility, such as 6 positions in the

      </a>, to adapt as your baby grows.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Comfort and Ergonomic Design:</strong> The carrier should support the baby's natural "M" position, as seen in

      and other GROWNSY products, to prevent strain and ensure hip health.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Ease of Use:</strong> It should be easy to put on and adjust, with features like adjustable waistbands in the

  <h2>How Baby Carriers Work and Maintenance</h2>
  <p>
    Baby carriers work by distributing the baby's weight across the parent's body, often using padded straps and waistbands to reduce strain. 
    They should support the baby's hips in an "M" position, as recommended by the International Hip Dysplasia Institute 
    (<em><a href="https://hipdysplasia.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Baby Carriers &amp; Other Equipment - International Hip Dysplasia Institute</a></em>). 
    Maintenance involves regular cleaning with appropriate agents, checking for wear, and ensuring proper fit to maintain safety and comfort, 
    as advised by GROWNSY (<em>Steps to use baby carrier ‚Äì GROWNSY</em>).
